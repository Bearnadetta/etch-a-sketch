To do:

Prevent squares from being draggable- have the mouseenter event only trigger while the mouse is held down to simulate drawing.

Increment the opacity of the squares on multiple passes 

Improve CSS

change the 'change size' button from a button that prompts the user to a more user-friendly selection method

This project really felt like it 'clicked' for me. Coming up with ideas, researching methods, and implementing solutions felt like a natural part of my problem solving process instead of a slog down a predetermined path. I still have ideas for improving this project, but I think there will be a cutoff point where I intend to leave this as-is so that I can come back and see what I considered a "completed" project a few months from now to gauge my progress.
